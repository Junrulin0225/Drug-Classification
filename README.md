#### Introduction
Welcome to the **Drug Classification Project**ðŸ’Š!


To practice classification using the dataset related to my background, in this project, I am going to use this drug data to **explore and predict the drug type with machine learning skills**. 
I want to see with data cleaning, EDA, and different models, how accurate it is to predict what drugs to use for new patients. 

#### Dataset explained
- Na_to_K ratio: Sodium to Potassium ratio in the human body. The recommended Sodium to Potassium ratio for humans is 1:3. That is Potassium intake should be 3 times higher than Sodium intake.
- BP: Blood pressure levels


#### Workflow
- Step 1 (EDA): For numerical variables, I used the histogram to see if there is skew and the boxplot to observe how the data is distributed.

As for categorical variables, I checked the counts for each value.

- Step 2 (feature engineering): I used get.dummies() to convert categorical features to numeric form.

- Step 3 (model training and prediction): fitted different models and compared the accuracy. 

#### Result and Discussion
Among the 6 models, the decision tree and random forest models have the best outcome and performance.
