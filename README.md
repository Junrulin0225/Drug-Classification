#### Introduction
Welcome to the **Drug Classification Project**ðŸ’Š!


In order to practice classification using the dataset related to my background, in this project, I am going to use this drug data to **explore and predict the drug type with machine learning skills**. 
I want to see with data cleaning, EDA and different models, hwo accuarte it is to predict what drugs to use for new patients. 

## Dataset explained
- Na_to_K ratio : Sodium to Potassium ratio in human body. The recommended Sodium to Potassium ratio for humans is 1:3. That is Potassium intake should be 3 times higher than Sodium intake.
- BP : Blood pressure levels


#### Workflow
- Step 1: 

- Step 2: 

- Step 3:
